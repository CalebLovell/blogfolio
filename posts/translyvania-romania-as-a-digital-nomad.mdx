### Quick Summary

The Translyvanian capital of Cluj-Napoca is a beautiful city with a rich history and a growing tech scene. The small mountain city of Brașov is nestled in the Carpathians with stunning views and easy access to nature.

There is a limited nomad or expat community in either city, but still plenty to do and see in both!

With excellent food, safety, and internet services at a much cheaper price tag than Western Europe, Romania is definitely an underrated nomad destination.

### Pros

-  Both cities are very walkable with great public transportation systems that connect to the rest of the country
-  Extremely safe - Romania has one of the lowest crime rates in the world
-  Amazing cuisine with influence from the Germans, Turks, Hungarians, and many more...
-  Fascinating history from Dacia and the Romans to various European Empires over the ages
-  Excellent online infrastructure. Some of the fastest internet in the world, mind-blowingly cheap phone service ($5 for basically unlimited calls, text, and data per month), apps and websites that worked well, etc.
-  English spoken nearly fluently by most young people, and many older people as well (decreases as you leave the city centers)
-  Cheap rent and cost of living
-  Quiet and relaxed pace of life
-  Quite a few events for locals, every weekend held a festival or event of some kind (music, food, etc.)
-  Good coworking options

### Cons

-  Very small expat community, and almost no digital nomad community meant there were no meetups or events
-  Somewhat closed culture. People are friendly, but it's definitely harder to make friends
-  The Romanian language was much harder than I expected. The latin roots help, but there are a _ton_ of grammatical and vocab differences from the other Romance languages

### Personal Experience

I stayed in Cluj for 3 weeks at an AirBnB on Strada Iuliu Maniu, right off the old town city center for about $25/night. In Brașov, I spent a week in an AirBnB of a cute studio apartment on Strada Postăvarului for around $21/night. Both locations were within the old city centers, and made walking everywhere easy. And despite being so close to the action, both places were absolutely silent at night!

I won't lie, the first few days in Romania proved a bit tough, which caught me off guard as I like to think I am sort of immune to culture shock these days! But between the jet lag, the surprising difficulty of the language, and the lack of much international community, I felt a bit out of place. Thankfully, that feeling didn't last long, and I started to really enjoy my daily routine! I found lots of delicious cafes and restaurants, and nice coworking places with friendly people to work alongside.

Between the amazing food (I am a sucker for little Donër Kebab shops, of which there were _many_), the beautiful parks, and the laid back pace of life, both cities felt like they would be excellent places to raise a family. And as an extreme night owl, I found the peaceful streets particularly beautiful at night, and I enjoyed going for walks long after midnight without having to worry about crime, something I definitely would not feel safe doing in most cities I've lived in.

And a quick note on the language for Romance language speakers - I speak Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, so I thought it would be easy to pick up Romanian as well with its shared Latin roots. But I found myself unable to understand much of anything at first, and even after a month of practice I was limited to simple sentences and canned phrases at best. I found it to be a very interesting language, and I would like to return to fully learn it someday, but I should not have expected to be able to pick it up without a lot of work first! The grammar and vocabulary are both much farther removed from the other Romance languages than I would ever have thought!

### Conclusion

Overall, I had a great time in Romania. The social scene was a bit lacking, but I was able to make a few friends anyways, and the relaxed atmosphere helped me get a ton of work done.

I would definitely recommend either city for a few weeks for anyone that's interested in Romania. Cluj was a bit more lively, but Brașov was far more beautiful, and allowed for easier access to hiking and other outdoor activities. I probably would not return to Cluj, but I would happily spend a few months in Brașov if I get a chance!
