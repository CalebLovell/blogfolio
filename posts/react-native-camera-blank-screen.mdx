When using the package `expo-camera` or `react-native-camera`, you may encounter a blank screen with no error message showing.

Make sure that you are importing the permissions module from React Native and requesting access to a user's camera like this:

`import { Permissions } from 'react-native';`

If you forget to do it, nothing will work and you won't know why.

If you find this blog post and it solves your problem, congratulations, you are as dumb as I am! üòÅ

I spent about an hour before I realized what was wrong, so I thought I'd make a quick post in case anyone else ever does the same thing.

Have a great day!
