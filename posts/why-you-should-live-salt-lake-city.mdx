If Salt Lake City isn't on your radar yet, it should be! It's a lovely place to live, for the short or long term. There are lots of things that make it great, as well as a few that count against it. Here's a quick pros and cons list:

Pros

1. Great access to outdoor activities
2. Booming economy
3. Beautiful mountains all around
4. All four seasons of the year
5. Very family friendly

Cons

1. Air quality - since SLC is completely surrounded by mountains, smoke during the late summer, and smog during the winter months can make the air really nasty
2. Not very diverse - downtown SLC certainly has some diversity, but if you stray very far from the center, Utah is definitely a pretty monocultural place
3. The LDS (Mormon) Church dominates the government and culture - I have never met an unkind Mormon!! But if you aren't religious and/or conservative, you may feel a little out of place sometimes
