### Quick Summary

The Translyvanian capital of Cluj-Napoca, Romania is a beautiful city with a rich history and a growing tech scene.

There is a limited nomad or expat community in Cluj, but still plenty to do and see in the city.

With excellent food, safety, and internet services at a much cheaper price tag than Western Europe, Romania is definitely an underrated nomad destination.

### Pros

-  Walkable city center, and great public transportation system connected to the rest of the country
-  Extremely safe (Romania has one of the lowest crime rates in the world)
-  Amazing cuisine with influences from the Germans, Turks, Hungarians, and many more...
-  Fascinating history from Dacia and the Romans to various European Empires over the ages
-  Excellent online infrastructure. Some of the fastest internet in the world, mind-blowingly cheap phone service ($5 for basically unlimited calls, text, and data per month), apps and websites that worked well, etc.
-  English spoken nearly fluently by most young people, and many older people as well (decreases slightly as you get further from the city center)
-  Cheap rent and cost of living
-  Despite being the 2nd biggest city in Romania, it still felt very quiet and relaxed
-  Quite a few events for locals, every weekend held a festival or event of some kind (music, food, etc.)
-  Several good coworking options

### Cons

-  Very small expat community, and almost no digital nomad community meant there were no meetups or events
-  The city center is fairly small, and there's not much going on on an average night
-  Much more closed culture. People are friendly, but it's definitely harder to make friends than I am used to
-  The Romanian language was much harder than I expected. The latin roots help, but there are a _ton_ of grammatical and vocab differences from the other Romance languages

### Personal Experience

I stayed in Cluj for 3 weeks at an AirBnB on Strada Iuliu Maniu, right off the old town city center for about $25/night. Everything was within walking distance, and I was surprised at how quiet it still was - at night, it was absolutely silent! The construction, like most apartments in the area, opened into a cute little internal courtyard which helped keep the temperate cool during the hottest summer days.

I won't lie, the first few days proved a bit tough, which caught me off guard as I like to think I am sort of immune to culture shock these days! But between the jet lag, the surprising difficulty of the Romanian languages, and the lack of much international community, I felt a bit out of place. Thankfully, that feeling didn't last long, and I started to really enjoy my daily routine! I found lots of delicious cafes and restaurants, and a nice coworking place with very friendly people called Silicon Forest.

Between the amazing food (I am a sucker for little Donër Kebab shops, of which there were _many_ in Cluj), the beautiful city parks, and the laid back pace of life, it felt like it would be an excellent place to raise a family. And as an extreme night owl, I found the peaceful streets particularly beautiful at night, and I enjoyed going for walks around the city long after midnight without having to worry about crime, something I definitely would not feel safe doing in most cities I've lived in.

### Conclusion

Overall, I had a great time in Cluj. The social scene was a bit lacking, but I was able to make a few friends and the atmosphere helped me get a ton of work done.

I would definitely recommend it for a few weeks for anyone that's interest in Romania, though in the end, I felt it was outclassed by my next destination in Brașov, Romania, but for that story you'll have to read my next post...
